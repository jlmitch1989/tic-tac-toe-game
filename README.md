  As a user, I want the game to have something unique, so it's not the average Tic-Tac-Toe.
  As a user, I want to see a message pop up to tell me when I have won.
  As a user, I want a button that allows me to restart the game when ever I want.

-   How you plan to keep your code modular.
-   What creative spin will you add to your project.
    Instead of X's and O's, I'm going to use pictures of tic tac and toes.

-   How you will use version control to backup / track your project.
